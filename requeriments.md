## Background:
The customer would like to build an Equipment Tracking module that allows our customers to allocate construction equipment for their jobs. Examples of construction equipment include trucks, forklifts, cranes, etc. Tracking the usage of equipment in hours, days, and weeks is essential to enable our customers to bill their clients for the use of equipment.

## Requirements:
- [x] User can see a list of equipment and their current statuses.
- [x] User can check out specific equipment.
- [x] User can return specific equipment that they checked out.
- [x] User cannot check out equipment that is already checked out.
- [ ] For the simplicity of the assignment, assume the Job ID as a string identifier (self-reported by the user).
- [ ] When returning equipment, the user needs to specify the location where the equipment will be dropped.
- [ ] (optional) If equipment is not available, the user can request to obtain this equipment later (as soon as it becomes available or on a specific date).
- [ ] (optional) The user can filter equipment by location and equipment type (e.g., truck, forklift, etc).
